# ABOUT THE NOTEBOOK # .Code appears between colons :🤩✴🌊🌊:

* This notebook walks you through how to train a baseline Random Forest model using TensorFlow Decision Forests on the Spaceship Titanic dataset made available for this competition.Code appears between colons :🌊😁🧨:

* Random Forest is a widely used classification and regression algorithm. As classification and regression are the most significant aspects of machine learning, we can say that the Random Forest Algorithm is one of the most important algorithms in machine learning.Code appears between colons :😁🧨:

* The capacity to correctly classify observations is helpful for various business applications, such as predicting whether; a specific user would buy a product or a loan will default or not.Code appears between colons :🌊😁:

* Classification algorithms in data science include logistic regression, support vector machines, naive Bayes classifiers, and decision trees. On the other hand, the random forest classifier is near the top of the classifier hierarchy.Code appears between colons :🌊😁🧨:

# ABOUT THE COMPETITION # 🌊🔥
* Welcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. We've received a transmission from four lightyears away and things aren't looking good.Code appears between colons :🔥:

* The Spaceship Titanic was an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago. With almost 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel set out on its maiden voyage transporting emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets orbiting nearby stars.Code appears between colons :🧑‍🚒:

* While rounding Alpha Centauri en route to its first destination—the torrid 55 Cancri E—the unwary Spaceship Titanic collided with a spacetime anomaly hidden within a dust cloud. Sadly, it met a similar fate as its namesake from 1000 years before. Though the ship stayed intact, almost half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension!Code appears between colons :🔥:

* To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system.Markup : Code appears between colons :🧨:
